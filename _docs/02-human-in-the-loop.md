## Introduction

I've developed a system that generates 3D wound models combining 2D semantic segmentation with 3D reconstruction so that they can be printed via 3D bio-printers during the surgery to treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs).

The 2D segmentation based on deeplearning model was aimed to simplify the surgery process and reduce difficulties of elaborate drawing of wound area.
